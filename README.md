# Profiling IoT botnet activty (BotPro)
### Project Information:

The highly heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and their broad deployments have resulted in the emergence of numerous security issues and measurement-based difficulties, which strongly impede the collection, analysis, and correlation of IoT-centric data. Therefore, it is significantly important to build an empirical ground truth data and perform a macroscopic measurements analysis in order to adequately profile and track the activity of IoT botnet the wild.

# BotPro Analysis Dashboard

BotPro is an open-source cybersecurity dashboard for profiling IoT botnet activity. This tool offers a range of features and visualizations to help you analyze and understand the behavior of IoT botnets.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up BotPro on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/) (Make sure Docker is installed and running)
- MongoDB for storing and managing data, can be installed by referring to the installation instructions provided at [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- RabbitMQ for message queuing and communication between components of this project. Downloading instructions at [RabbitMQ Downloads](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).
- MongoDB by referring to the installation instructions provided at [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/almazarqi/BotPro.git
cd BotPro


### 2.Features & Benefits
A. Scanning analysis: shows the scanning behavior of IoT botnets by analyzing real-world data collected through BotPro.

B. Bot Loaders:  processes the payload structures to profile IoT botnet loaders that were used in the initial stages of an infection. It resposible to detect teh bot loaders and related to malware varaients.

C. AS level: conduct a comprehensive AS-level analysis of IoT botnet propagation using the measurement infrastructure and shows the influence of AS structural properties on the spread and tolerance of IoT botnet activities.  It operates at the AS- level, and provides a macroscopic view of IoT botnet activities and their origine.

D. Blacklists: leverages  widely-used IP blacklists and  evaluate their effeciency in capturing IoT botnet activity.

E. Infections: analyze the nature and types of malware deployed in botnet activities, nad provides insights into how infections spread and their impact.

#### Dataset:
The first layer of our proposed framework aims to build a real ground truth data. In order to build such data, it is essential to operate with Open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds that presents real IoT-based botnets traffic. Globally distributed honeypots has been utilized to simulate any vulnerabilities which can easily be compromised by malicious actors. Real malicious events, including scanning and infections can be collected by monitoring such honeypots.

## External services
#### - Attack Honeypots:
collect cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data generated by attack honeypots. The honeypots detect active botnets by emulating hundreds of vulnerable IoT devices, including IP cameras, smart home devices and consumer-grade routers frequently targeted by botnets that scan the internet and engage in malicious activity.
#### - IP address reputation:
Four different IP global IP blacklist databases used in this work including: (i) Spamhaus, (ii) Barracuda, (iii) Spam Open Relay Blocking System (SORBS, and (iv) Composite Blocking List (CBL).

#### - BGP routing:
provide information about the AS-level connectivity of the Internet. It assess the impact of botnets on the overall Internet infrastructure.
#### - DNS: 
leverages DNS data to resolve domain names associated with suspicious IP addresses, and shows the bhaviour of botnet in locating the C&C servers.
#### - Geographic distribution: 
integrates geographic data such as MaxMind to visualise and trace the geographic origins of IoT botnet activities. It aids in identifying the source regions of attacks.

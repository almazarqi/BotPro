# Profiling IoT botnet activty (Probot)
### Project Information:

The highly heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and their broad deployments have resulted in the emergence of numerous security issues and measurement-based difficulties, which strongly impede the collection, analysis, and correlation of IoT-centric data. Therefore, it is significantly important to build an empirical ground truth data and perform a macroscopic measurements analysis in order to adequately profile and track the activity of IoT botnet the wild. 

#### Dataset
The first layer of our proposed framework aims to build a real ground truth data. In order to build such data, it is essential to operate with Open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds that presents real IoT-based botnets traffic. Globally distributed honeypots has been utilized to simulate any vulnerabilities which can easily be compromised by malicious actors. Real malicious events, including scanning and infections can be collected by monitoring such honeypots.

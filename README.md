# Profiling IoT botnet activty (Probot)
The highly heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and their broad deployments have resulted in the emergence of numerous security issues and measurement-based difficulties, which strongly impede the collection, analysis, and correlation of IoT-centric data. Therefore, it is significantly important to build an empirical ground truth data and perform a macroscopic measurements analysis in order to adequately profile and track the activity of IoT botnet the wild.
